# UniChoice

This app was created for Infomatrix 2018. The project was presented as an idea to help high school students with admission to
foreign Universities. Since I was a 11th grade student, I, like all my peers, began to think about applying for foreign universities. Looking for information on various universities, I had to face some problems, such as a large amount of information, difficulties with translation into Kazakh or Russian languages, and the lack of integrity of this information. These difficulties prompted me to create this application, which would not only help with the search for the University, but also help with the choice of specialty while cooperating with universities from all over the world.
